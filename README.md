#machine learning project
The aim of project is to generate a restaurant revenue prediction system using machine algorithm. 
The target audience are the people willing to make new investments in the restaurant business.
Large investments of time and capital are required to run a restaurant business. If the business fails for some reason, the investing party incurs heavy loss.
Our project considers and examines various parameters from the given data sets.
